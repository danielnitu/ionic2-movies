### What is it?
Mobile app that shows Most Popular / Top Rated / Upcoming movies. It displays the movie poster, title, description and IMDB rating.
### How does it work?
The application connects to an external API and retrieves data, which it then parses and presents in a user-friendly manner.
### Why do it?
The main goal was to test my skills in Ionic, Typescript and Angular 2. This is the first time I've used these technologies.
