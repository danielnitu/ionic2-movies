### What have I accomplished?
Pretty much everything that was asked, except for the Bonus feature, the implementation of a chat service. I didn't have the time to set up a back-end service and a database for user authentication.

### How does it work?
The application connects to an external API and retrieves data, which it then parses and presents in a user-friendly manner.
